  <p class="story">Welcome to the site! The site structure is mostly done but I'll still be adding animations, tweaking a few things and getting hosting for my projects. Please check back again soon. Leaving everything on the table I am an entirely self-taught developer with an Architecture background. During my technologist days I found myself exposed to web technologies and it piqued my interest. Since then I have immersed myself in Web Development and I haven't looked back. I enjoy picking up new technologies for interesting projects and have experience in working in teams with constantly changing project requirements. When I'm not coding or reading about code, you can find me on my bike along Harbour Front.</p>
